       <h2>Tip Calculator</h2>
       <p><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python">Harvard.EDX.org/TipCalculator</a></p>
       <p> As a prerequisite for my CS class, I learned Python through Harvard EDX. This is an assignment that I coded for that course and it's able to calculate tip amounts. First, the program prompts the user to input an amount and the percent they want to tip. Then, it calculates that amount by multiplying the dollar amount and the percentage. This program is able to calculate any amount with any percentage and is useful if you’re not sure how much to tip.

       <h2>Polygon Generator</h2>
       <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/899092459">scratch.mit.edu/anika.polygongenerator</a></p>
       <p> In scratch, me and my partner Grace were able to create a polygon generator together. Meant for kids to learn their shapes, this program is able to draw any shape and includes default options such as triangles and even circles. As an extra, we added “buttons” and coded each one to receive the shape’s code when clicked.

       <h2>Classical Painting</h2>
       <p> This is a painting I created for my art final. The scene is from the movie “Crimson Peak" however, I added some of my own details especially in the background in order to change the mood of the painting. I solely used acrylic paints to create this piece and my aim focused on the theme of classical art that was depicted in ancient Roman and Greek paintings.
